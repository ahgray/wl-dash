# Technical Requirements

## API Integrations

### NFL Data API
**Primary**: ESPN API (free, reliable)
- Endpoint: `http://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/scoreboard`
- Data needed: Team records, game results, schedule
- Update frequency: After each game completion (check every 30 minutes)
- Backup data sources: NFL.com API if ESPN fails

### Betting Odds Integration
**Source**: The Odds API or similar
- Endpoint for NFL odds and predictions
- Used for enhanced probability calculations
- Cache odds data to minimize API calls
- Fallback to ELO-only calculations if unavailable

### Grok AI Integration
**Purpose**: Weekly narrative generation
- API: Grok through X.ai platform
- Prompt engineering for dramatic, humorous sports commentary
- Triggered weekly (Sunday night after games complete)
- Backup: Simple template-based summaries if API fails

## Data Management

### File Structure & Schemas

**config/players.json**
```json
{
  "leagueName": "Football Winners and Jets",
  "season": "2025",
  "players": {
    "player1": {
      "name": "John Doe", 
      "teams": ["KC", "BUF", "MIA", "NYJ"]
    }
  }
}
```

**data/results.json**
```json
{
  "lastUpdated": "2025-09-09T20:30:00Z",
  "currentWeek": 1,
  "teams": {
    "KC": {"wins": 0, "losses": 0, "ties": 0, "elo": 1500},
    "BUF": {"wins": 1, "losses": 0, "ties": 0, "elo": 1520}
  }
}
```

**data/history.json**
```json
{
  "weeks": {
    "1": {
      "date": "2025-09-09",
      "playerStats": {
        "player1": {"totalWins": 2, "totalLosses": 2, "weeklyChange": "+1"}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Caching Strategy
- Cache NFL data for 15 minutes during games
- Cache betting odds for 1 hour
- Store team logos locally in public/team-logos/
- Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern

### Error Handling & Recovery
- Retry failed API calls with exponential backoff
- Fallback to last known good data if APIs unavailable
- Log errors to console/file for debugging
- Graceful degradation when features fail

## Statistical Calculations

### ELO Rating System
```javascript
// Initial ELO: 1500 for all teams
// K-factor: 32 for regular season, 40 for playoffs
// Update after each game based on result and expected outcome
```

### Probability Engine
- Monte Carlo simulations (1000+ iterations)
- Factor in remaining schedule strength
- Weight recent performance more heavily
- Include betting market implied probabilities

### Key Metrics to Calculate
- Win/Loss probability for season end
- "Magic numbers" to clinch first place
- Strength of schedule (remaining games)
- Performance efficiency (wins per games played)
- Momentum indicators (recent 4-week trends)

## Update Scheduling

### Game Completion Detection
```javascript
// Check NFL API for completed games
// Trigger updates only when new results detected
// Avoid unnecessary API calls during bye weeks
```

### Update Workflow
1. Fetch latest NFL scores
2. Compare with stored data
3. If changes detected:
   - Update team records
   - Recalculate all statistics
   - Check for new achievements
   - Update historical data
   - Generate social graphics if major milestone

### Fallback Schedule
- Primary: Check 30 minutes after scheduled game end times
- Secondary: Hourly checks during NFL game days
- Tertiary: Daily checks during bye weeks

## Performance Optimization

### Bundle Size
- Lazy load charts and heavy components
- Optimize images and team logos
- Tree shake unused dependencies
- Use Next.js built-in optimizations

### Runtime Performance  
- Memoize expensive calculations
- Debounce rapid updates
- Use React.memo for static components
- Implement virtual scrolling if needed

### SEO & Accessibility
- Server-side rendering for initial load
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- High contrast ratios for readability
- Keyboard navigation support

## Security Considerations

### API Keys
- Store in environment variables
- Never expose in client-side code
- Rotate keys periodically
- Implement rate limiting

### Data Validation
- Validate all API responses
- Sanitize user inputs (if any added later)
- Implement CSRF protection for API routes
- Use TypeScript for compile-time safety

## Deployment Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
NFL_API_KEY=your_espn_api_key
ODDS_API_KEY=your_odds_api_key  
GROK_API_KEY=your_grok_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_LEAGUE_NAME="Football Winners and Jets"
```

### Build Process
- Next.js static generation where possible
- Optimize images during build
- Generate service worker for offline support
- Create deployment checklist

### Monitoring
- Error tracking (built-in Next.js analytics)
- Performance monitoring
- API usage tracking
- User analytics (privacy-compliant)

## Browser Support

### Target Browsers
- Chrome 90+
- Safari 14+
- Firefox 88+
- Mobile Safari (iOS 14+)
- Mobile Chrome (Android 10+)

### Progressive Enhancement
- Core functionality works without JavaScript
- Enhanced features require modern browser
- Graceful fallbacks for older browsers
- Offline support for viewing cached data
