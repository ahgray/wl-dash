## Technical Implementation Details

### 12. Update Scheduling System
**Purpose**: Automated data refreshing without manual intervention

**Primary Schedule**:
```javascript
// Game completion detection
const gameEndTimes = getScheduledGameTimes();
gameEndTimes.forEach(gameTime => {
  scheduleUpdate(gameTime + 30 * 60 * 1000); // 30 min after scheduled end
});
```

**Fallback Schedule**:
- Every 30 minutes during NFL game days (Thu/Sun/Mon)
- Hourly checks during non-game days
- Daily overnight sync for data consistency
- Manual trigger endpoint for emergency updates

**Error Handling**:
```javascript
// Retry logic with exponential backoff
const maxRetries = 3;
const baseDelay = 1000; // 1 second

async function updateWithRetry(attempt = 1) {
  try {
    await updateNFLData();
  } catch (error) {
    if (attempt < maxRetries) {
      const delay = baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt - 1);
      setTimeout(() => updateWithRetry(attempt + 1), delay);
    } else {
      console.error('Failed to update after max retries');
      // Continue with last known good data
    }
  }
}
```

### 13. Caching Strategy
**Purpose**: Minimize API calls and improve performance

**Cache Levels**:
- **Browser Cache**: Static assets (logos, icons) - 30 days
- **API Response Cache**: NFL data - 15 minutes during games, 1 hour off-season
- **Generated Content Cache**: Social images - 24 hours
- **Statistical Calculations**: Complex probability models - 1 hour

**Cache Invalidation**:
- Force refresh when new game results detected
- Version timestamps for cache busting
- Stale-while-revalidate pattern for seamless updates

### 14. Error Handling & Fallbacks
**Purpose**: Graceful degradation when external services fail

**Fallback Hierarchy**:
1. **Primary NFL API** (ESPN) - Real-time updates
2. **Secondary NFL API** (NFL.com) - Backup data source  
3. **Cached Data** - Last known good state
4. **Static Fallback** - Basic team records from config

**User Experience During Failures**:
- Clear status indicators when data is stale
- Estimated next update time display
- Manual refresh button availability
- Graceful error messages without technical jargon

**Monitoring & Alerts**:
- API uptime tracking
- Error rate monitoring
